# TaMper

TaMper is a programming language made by XSX (maggixx) and MartyBoi (imdoingthisfortheprofile).
It is designed to be simple to read and use, but not for actual productivity.
TaMper is written in python, and uses simple commands.


##Variables
TaMper has variables, that can be referenced in some commands and can be created and set, but not deleted.

##Speak
The speak command takes one argument, and it will output whatever that argument is onto the console.
Syntax :
```
speak [output]
```
Example :
```
speak hello world
-----------------
Output :
hello world
```
